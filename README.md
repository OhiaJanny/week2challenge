Hello,
This is my portfolio of work as week 2 challenge in Trilogy Bootcamp. This Portfolio showcases my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

 This portfolio  highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. In this portfolio,  I have some of my  deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web). 

With these points in my mind,  this Challenge has helped me set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

Below is the Link to deployment and the link to the repository.
